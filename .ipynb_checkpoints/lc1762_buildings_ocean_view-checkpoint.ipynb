    " ### 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View\n",
    "\n",
    "There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]\n",
    "Output: [0,2,3]\n",
    "Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]\n",
    "Output: [0,1,2,3]\n",
    "Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]\n",
    "Output: [3]\n",
    "Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= heights.length <= 105\n",
    "1 <= heights[i] <= 109"
