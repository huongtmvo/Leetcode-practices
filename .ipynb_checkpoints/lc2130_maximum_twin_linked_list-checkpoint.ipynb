    "In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",

    "Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.\n",
    "There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.\n",

    "The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:\n",
