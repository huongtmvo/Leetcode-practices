    "You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.\n",

    "Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.\n",
