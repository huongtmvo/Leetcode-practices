    "#### 2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors\n",
    "There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input: colors = [1,1,1,6,1,1,1]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.\n",
    "The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.\n",
    "House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.\n",
    "Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "Input: colors = [1,8,3,8,3]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.\n",
    "The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.\n",
    "House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "Input: colors = [0,1]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.\n",
    "House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.\n",

    "Constraints:\n",

    "n == colors.length\n",
    "2 <= n <= 100\n",
    "0 <= colors[i] <= 100\n",
    "Test data are generated such that at least two houses have different colors."
